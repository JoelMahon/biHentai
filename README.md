# biHentai
A chrome extension that turns nHentai.net from a degenerate website for degenerates, into a language learning opportunity for degenerates.

## License

I plan to release this on the chrome store as a free extension eventually, after I work out any kinks, and do some major polish (both in back end and in the front end).

Up until then I don't want anyone releasing it and charging money or something so it's not copy right free just because I'm paranoid.

## User Installation

Remember, to use an extension during incognito/InPrivate browsing, you have to enable that explcitiy...

Once it's on the chrome store, then just install it like any other chrome extension.

You can download it and use it yourself before I put it on the chrome store. To do this (Edge instructions):

1. Download the repo.
2. Go to your browser (should work on Chrome/Edge for sure, probably most others too).
3. Options -> Extensions.
4. Enable developer mode.
5. Load Upacked -> Navigate to INSIDE the downloaded repo -> Select Folder.
6. Enjoy!

## Use

biHentai in it's current form is intuitive to use I am proud to say, helps when it does so little! There are no options or settings either.

1. Go to a page of any hentai that has a translated version on the site, any language works.
2. Click the „ÅÇ on the new widget in the bottom left of the page to toggle languages.
3. The first time you do it you will be prompted to provide the query to find an alternate version of the hentai.
4. A default query is provided that should often work, but may require manual tweaking to get right.
5. If your query worked then the image should update.
6. Sometimes the pages are out of sync, you can press the -/+ symbols to change the "offset" of the other work until the pages match up.
7. Navigate using my widget. I'm not a control freak, I just couldn't get my code to integrate nicely with their javascript...
8. Toggle as you wish!
